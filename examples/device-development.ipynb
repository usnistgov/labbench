    "###### 2.1.1 Implementing state traits with the command argument\n",

    "\n",
    "The `VISADevice` driver tries to use the command argument for each state trait to determine how to communicate with the remote instrument on assignment. In `PowerSensor` above, a get or set the frequency state defined with the command `'SENS:FREQ'` would be implemented by querying or writing the SCPI string `'SENS:FREQ?'` or `'SENS:FREQ 1e9'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2.1.2 Implementing a state trait setter manually\n",
    "Implementing gets and sets of simple traits sometimes requires custom logic. This arises for backend drivers that do not support a simple command structure that can be easily specified with a single `command` argument. Even for devices that do generally support this type of command structure, custom logic is sometimes needed for \"quirky\" or nonstandard commands. The definition of `PowerSensor` above includes two cases from driver code written for actual commercial power sensors.\n",

    "        self.write('SENSe:FUNCtion \"{}\"'.format(value))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "VISADevice assumes that the state called \"function,\" defined with\n",
    "the keyword argument key='SENS:FUNC',\n",
    "should be set on the remote device using the SCPI string formatted\n",
    "as 'SENS:FUNC POW:AVG' (where POW:AVG might be replaced by other\n",
    "enum values in the definition of function above).\n",
    "\n",
    "This power sensor expects quotes around the parameter supplied to\n",
    "set SENS:FUNC --- for example 'SENS:FUNC \"POW:AVG\"'.\n",

    "in VISADevice with this custom behavior.\n",

    "* The decorator syntax `@state.function.setter` is what connects\n",
    "  this implementation to state.function.\n",
    "* This only replaces the VISADevice state *setting* behavior. The\n",
    "  state *getting* behavior is still the default.\n",
    "* The name of the method, '__', hides it from users of the class driver;\n",
    "  it shouldn't need to be called except to implement\n",
    "  state.function.setter.\n",
    "* All state setting functions take one argument in addition to self,\n",
    "  which is the value to send to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2.1.3 Implementing a state trait getter manually\n",
    "Here is the manually implemented getter method from `PowerSensor`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    @state.trigger_source.getter\n",
    "    def __ (self):\n",
    "        source = self.query('TRIG:SOUR?')\n",

    "            source = 'EXT2'\n",
    "        return source\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "VISADevice assumes that the state called \"trigger_source,\" defined with\n",
    "the keyword argument key='TRIG:SOUR',\n",
    "should be queried on the remote device using the SCPI string formatted\n",
    "as 'TRIG:SOUR?'. It also expects that the response can be converted\n",
    "to the specified data type - in this case one of the enumerated strings,\n",
    "such as 'EXT2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quirks that do not follow this pattern are common for getters (queries),\n",
    "like the setters above. For example, this power sensor returns\n",
    "'2' instead of 'EXT2', even though it expects the parameter 'EXT2'\n",
    "for a set operation. This function implements the special case to\n",
    "replace '2' (if returned by the device) with 'EXT2' so that there\n",
    "are no errors if we try to get and set the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method replaces the automatic parameter setting implemented\n",
    "in VISADevice with this custom behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The decorator syntax `@state.trigger_source.getter` is what connects\n",
    "  this implementation to state.trigger_source.\n",
    "* This only replaces the VISADevice state *getting* behavior. The\n",
    "  state *setting* behavior is still the default.\n",
    "* The name of the method, '__', duplicates the function.setter (above).\n",
    "  This doesn't matter, since it shouldn't need to be called separately\n",
    "  by a user anyway.\n",
    "* These state getting functions take no arguments besides `self`, and return\n",
    "  the value received from the device.       \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2 Using state traits to control the device\n",

Since these aren't listed here, it can get confusing tracking what has been inherited (like in other object-oriented libraries). Fortunately, there are many ways to explore the entire list of states that have been inherited from the parent state class:\n",
    "1. Look it up [in the API reference manual](http://ssm.ipages.nist.gov/labbench/labbench.html#labbench.visa.VISADevice.state)\n",
    "2. When working with an instantiated driver object in an ipython or jupyter notebook command prompt, type `lb.VISADevice.state.` and press tab to autocomplete a list of valid options. You'll also see some functions to do esoteric things with these states.\n",
    "3. When working in an editor like pycharm or spyder, you can ctrl+click on the right side of `VISADevice.state` to skip directly to looking at the definition of `VISADevice.state` in the `labbench` library\n",

    "### 3. Device methods for commands and data acquisition\n",
    "The `state` class above is useful for remote assignment operations on simple scalar data types. Supporting a broader collection of operation types (\"trigger a measurement,\" \"fetch and return measurement data,\" etc.) need the flexibility of more general-purpose functions. In python, a member function of a class is called a method.\n",

    "def preset (self):\n",
    "    self.write('SYST:PRES')\n",
    "\n",
    "def fetch (self):\n",
    "    response = self.query('FETC?').split(',')\n",
    "    if len(response)==1:\n",
    "        return float(response[0])\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return pd.to_numeric(pd.Series(response))\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are the methods that are specific to our power sensor device. \n",
    "* The `preset` function tells the device to revert to its default state.\n",
    "* The `fetch` method performs some text processing on the response from the device, and returns either a single scalar or a pandas Series if the result is a sequence of power values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `labbench` convention is that the names of these methods are verbs (or sentence predicates, when single words are not specific enough).\n",
