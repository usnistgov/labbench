    "Let's work through what this does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Every `labbench` driver is a subclass of a labbench Device class, such as lb.VISADevice:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the definition of the PowerSensor:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PowerSensor(lb.VISADevice):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This single line gives our power sensor driver all of the general capabilities of a VISA driver this driver class (known as \"subclassing\" \"inheriting\" in software engineering). This means that in this one line, the PowerSensor driver has adopted _all of the same member and attribute features as a \"plain\" VISADevice_. The `VISADevice` class helps streamline use of the `pyvisa` with features like\n",
    "* managing connection and disconnection, given a VISA resource string;\n",
    "* shortcuts for accessing simple instrument states, implemented entirely based on definitions (discussed below); and\n",
    "* wrapper methods (i.e., member functions) for pyvisa resource `write` and `query` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complete listing of everything that comes with `lb.VISADevice` is in the [programming reference](http://ssm.ipages.nist.gov/labbench/labbench.html#labbench.backends.VISADevice).\n",
    "\n",
    "This power sensor driver definition is just that - a definition. To _use_ the driver and connect to the instrument in the lab, instantiate it and connect to the device. This is the simplest recommended way to instantiate, connect, and then disconnect in a script:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Here is the `with` block\n",
    "with PowerSensor('TCPIP::10.0.0.1::::INSTR') as sensor:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "    # The sensor is connected in this \"with\" block. Afterward, it disconnects, even\n",
    "    # if there is an exception. Automation code that uses the sensor would go here.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now the `with` block is done and we're disconnected\n",
    "print('Disconnected, all done')\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's nice to leave the sensor connected sometimes, like for interactive play on a python prompt. In that case, you can manually connect and disconnect:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sensor = PowerSensor('TCPIP::10.0.0.1::::INSTR')\n",
    "sensor.connect()\n",
    "# The sensor is connected now. Automation code that uses the sensor would go here.\n",
    "sensor.disconnect() # We have to manually disconnect when we don't use a with block.\n",
    "print('Disconnected, all done')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key pieces here:\n",
    "* The instantiation, `PowerSensor('TCPIP::10.0.0.1::::INSTR')`, is where we create a power sensor object that we can interact with. All `VISADevice` drivers use this standard resource string formatting; other types of drivers have different formats.\n",
    "* The `with` block (talked about under the name _context management_ in python language documents) serves two functions for any labbench driver (not just VISADevice):\n",
    "    1. The instrument is connected at the start of the with block\n",
    "    2. guarantees that the instrument will be disconnected after the with end of the with block, _even if there is an error inside the block!_\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Getting and setting simple parameters in the device the `state` object\n",
    "##### Reading the definition\n",
    "Each driver has an attribute called `state`. It is an optional way to give your users shortcuts to get and set simple instrument settings. This is the definition from the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    initiate_continuous = lb.Bool      (key='INIT:CONT')\n",
    "    output_trigger      = lb.Bool      (key='OUTP:TRIG')\n",
    "    trigger_source      = lb.EnumBytes (key='TRIG:SOUR', values=['IMM','INT','EXT','BUS','INT1'])\n",
    "    trigger_count       = lb.Int       (key='TRIG:COUN', min=1,max=200,step=1)\n",
    "    measurement_rate    = lb.EnumBytes (key='SENS:MRAT', values=['NORM','DOUB','FAST'])\n",
    "    sweep_aperture      = lb.Float     (key='SWE:APER',  min=20e-6, max=200e-3,help='time (in s)')\n",
    "    frequency           = lb.Float     (key='SENS:FREQ', min=10e6, max=18e9,help='input center frequency (in Hz)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VISADevice` driver uses the metadata given for each descriptor above to determine how to communicate with the remote instrument on assignment. Behind the scenes, the `state` object has extra features that can monitor changes to these states to automatically record the changes we make to these states to a database, or (in the future) automatically generate a GUI front-panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Every* labbench driver has a state object, including at least the boolean state called `connected` (indicating whether the host computer is connected with the remote device is connected or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### Using state attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Making an instance of PowerSensor - in the example, this was `PowerSensor('TCPIP::10.0.0.1::::INSTR')` - causes the `state` object to become interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment causes causes the setting to be applied to the instrument. For example, \n",
    "`sensor.state.initiate_continuous = True` makes machinery inside `lb.VISADevice` do the following:\n",
    "1. validate that `True` is a valid python boolean value (because we defined it as `lb.Bool`)\n",
    "2. convert the python boolean `True` to a string (because `lb.VISADevice` knows SCPI uses string commands)\n",
    "3. send the SCPI string `'INIT:CONT TRUE'` (because we told it the command string is `'INIT:CONT'`, and by default it assumes that settings should be applied as `'<command> <value>'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, a parameter \"get\" operation is triggered by simply using the attribute. The statement `print(sensor.state.initiate_continuous)` triggers `lb.VISADevice` to do the following:\n",
    "1. an SCPI query with the string `'INIT:CONT?'` (because we told it the command string is `'INIT:CONT'`, and by default it assumes that settings should be applied as `'<command>?'` with return values reported in a response string),\n",
    "2. the response string is converted to a python boolean type (because we defined it as `lb.Bool`),\n",
    "3. the converted boolean value is passed to the `print` function for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of assigning to and from states\n",
    "Here is working example that gets and sets parameter values by communicating with the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with PowerSensor('TCPIP::10.0.0.1::::INSTR') as sensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This prints True if we're still in the with block\n",
    "    print(sensor.state.isopen)    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Use SCPI to request the identity of the sensor,\n",
    "    # then return and print it. This was inherited from\n",
    "    # VISADevice, so it is available on any VISADevice driver.\n",
    "    print(sensor.state.identity)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # PowerSensor.state.frequency is defined as a float. Assigning\n",
    "    # to it causes logic inherited from lb.VISADevice\n",
    "    # to convert this to a string, and then write the SCPI string\n",
    "    # 'SENS:FREQ 2.45e9' to the instrument.\n",
    "    sensor.state.frequency = 2.45e9 # Set the power sensor center frequency to 2.45e9 GHz\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # We can also access the remote value of sensor.state.frequency.\n",
    "    # Behind the scenes, each time we fetch the value, magic in\n",
    "    # lb.VISADevice retrieves the current value from the instrument\n",
    "    # with the SCPI query 'SENS:FREQ?', and then converts it to a floating point\n",
    "    # number.\n",
    "    print('The sensor frequency is {} GHz'.format(sensor.state.frequency/1e9))\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(sensor.state.isopen) # Prints False - we're disconnected\n",
    "```\n",
    "Simply put: assigning to or from with the attribute in the driver state instance causes remote set or get operations. The python data type matches the definition in the `state` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discovering and navigating states\n",
    "Inheriting from `VISADevice` means that `PowerSensor.state` includes the seven states defined here, plus all others listed provided by VISADevice.state. Since these aren't listed here, it can get confusing tracking what has been inherited (like in other object-oriented libraries). Fortunately, there are many ways to explore the entire list of states that have been inherited from the parent state class:\n",
    "1. Look it up [in the API reference manual](http://ssm.ipages.nist.gov/labbench/labbench.html#labbench.visa.VISADevice.state)\n",
    "2. When working with an instantiated driver object in an ipython or jupyter notebook command prompt, type `lb.VISADevice.state.` and press tab to autocomplete a list of valid options. You'll also see some functions to do esoteric things with these states.\n",
    "3. When working in an editor like pycharm or spyder, you can ctrl+click on the right side of `VISADevice.state` to skip directly to looking at the definition of `VISADevice.state` in the `labbench` library\n",
    "4. When working in any kind of python prompt, you can use the `help` function\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   help(PowerSensor.state)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. When working in an ipython or jupyter prompt, a nicer option than 4. is the ipython help magick:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   PowerSensor.state?\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Writing state attributes\n",
    "The way we code this is a little unusual outside of python packages for web development. When we write a driver class, we add attributes defined with helper information such as\n",
    "- the python type that should represent the parameter\n",
    "- bounds for acceptable values of the parameter\n",
    "- descriptive \"help\" information for the user\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes are a kind of python type state class is a _descriptor_. We call them \"traits\" because following an underlying library that we extend, [traitlets](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets) under the hood. The example includes seven state traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "After instantiating with `PowerSensor()`, we can start interacting with `sensor.state`. Each one is now a live object we can assign to and use like any other python object. The difference is, each time we get the value, it is queried from the instrument, and each time we assign to it (the normal `=` operator), a set command goes to the instrument to set it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition above includes metadata that dictates the python data type handled for this assignment operation, and how it should be converted:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Descriptor metadata type**    \t| **Uses in `PowerSensor` example**  | **Behavior depends on the Device implementation** \t|\n",

    "### 3. Device methods for commands and data acquisition\n",
    "The `state` class above is useful for remote assignment operations on simple scalar data types. Supporting a broader collection of operation types (\"trigger a measurement,\" \"fetch and return measurement data,\" etc.) need the flexibility of more general-purpose functions. In python, a member function of a class is called a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the methods defined in `PowerSensor`:\n",

    "    response = self.query('FETC?').split(',')\n",
    "    if len(response)==1:\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        return pd.to_numeric(pd.Series(response))\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are the methods that are specific to our power sensor device. \n",
    "* The `preset` function tells the device to revert to its default state.\n",
    "* The `fetch` method performs some text processing on the response from the device, and returns either a single scalar or a pandas Series if the result is a sequence of power values.\n",
    "\n",
